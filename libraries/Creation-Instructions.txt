1. Compile wiki2ebook. A pre-compiled Linux binary is provided.
2. Download an .xml wiki dump.
   For creating a Wikipedia/Wiktionary/etc dump, go to
   http://download.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html
   and download the appropriate compressed .xml files
   (e.g. enwiktionary's pages-articles.xml.bz2).
   For creating an iPodLinux wiki dump, go to
   http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Special:Export
   and copy-paste the content of "iPL-Export-List.txt"
   into the text box, then save the export as a .xml file
   (you can generate your own list by copying the content of
   http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Special:Allpages, then replacing
   all tab characters with newline characters).
   Note that if you downloaded an archived dump (i.e. file
   extension of .xml.7z, .xml.bz2 or .xml.gz) you will need
   to first extract the .xml file with the appropriate tools.
3. Run "wiki2ebook blah.xml"
4. Create a duplicate of "ipodlinux-wiki-articles-YYYY-MM-DD.epodia"
   and modify it using an advanced text editor (e.g. your new file
   can be named "blah.epodia") - make sure the last two hex
   characters are "0A 0A"
5. Run the following commands in order:
   cat articleindex_top >> blah.epodia
   cat articleindex >> blah.epodia
   cat compressedarticles >> blah.epodia
6. You now have an .epodia file that should work with Encyclopodia
   (test it out - if its good, upload it and share it on the forums)
